1.	**Overview**

	The library offers a set of Interfaces for ABS-CBN’s Big Data recommendation engine. It is designed to have a small footprint on any digital property’s existing code base when integrated; it offers minimum method invocations for the two core functionalities, Writing Attributes and Reading Recommendations.  
	The focus of the design is to make an event tracking library that will be integrated into the different digital property where underlying functions and components are implemented and can be invoked within the library.
	The library is still in beta stage; recommendation reading and video attributes are not yet included.

This guide will show you how to integrate iOS event library into a native iOS ABS-CBN digital properties.

5.2	**Swift**
*Importing framework into Swift project*
1.	Copy the generated framework into the root folder of your project
2.	In the Project Navigator, select your project then select the target
3.	Select “General” tab.
4.	Open “Linked Frameworks and libraries” expander.
5.	Click the “+” button then “Add Other..”
6.	Locate and Select the ABSEventTracker.framework

Adding a Bridging Header
1. 1.	In the Project Navigator, Select File>New>File..
1. 2.	Select Objective-C file on the list the click next
1. 3.	Name the Objective-C file as Empty and choose the file type to Empty file.
1. 4.	A prompt dialog will show and click “Create Bridging Header”. Xcode will generate a <Project Name>-Bridging-Header.h file then delete the Empty.m file.
1. 5.	Select the <Project-Name.-Bridging-Header.h file and add the following:

```
#!objective-c

#import <ABSEventTracker/ABSEventTracker.h>
#import <ABSEventTracker/ABSEventTracker+Initializer.h>
#import <ABSEventTracker/EventAttributes.h>
#import <ABSEventTracker/UserAttributes.h>
```


Make sure to locate Objective – C bridging header into project’s build settings

6.	Integration
6.1	Objective – C
Initializing event tracker library
* 1.	Go to AppDelegate.m and import the ABSEventTracker 

```
#!objective-c

#import <ABSEventTracker/ABSEventTracker.h>
```

* 2.	Initialize the ABSEventTracker inside the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method by calling

```
#!objective-c

[ABSEventTracker initializeTracker];
```


***********************************************************

Initializing the user
Implement this builder function after the user’s successful login

```
#!objective-c

[UserAttributes *user = [UserAttributes makeWithBuilder:^(UserBuilder *builder) {
        [builder setGigyaID:@"agw2-avs2-zdzs-25zv-zc"];
        [builder setFirstName:@"Juan"];
        [builder setMiddleName:@"Dela"];
        [builder setLastName:@"Cruz"];
   
    }];
    [ABSEventTracker initWithUser:user];]
```


***********************************************************

**Tracking the Event**
The sample code below will gather all of the event attributes and send to the data lake.

```
#!objective-c

EventAttributes *attrib = [EventAttributes makeWithBuilder:^(EventBuilder *builder) {
        [builder setClickedContent:@"Button"];
        [builder setSearchQuery:@"Search..."];
        [builder setReadArticles:@"Philstar"];
        [builder setArticleAuthor:@"Bob Ong"];
        [builder setArticlePostDate:@"June 15, 2017"];

```


***********************************************************

**Tracking the Event**
The sample code below will gather all of the event attributes and send to the data lake.
